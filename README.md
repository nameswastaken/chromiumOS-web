# chromiumOS-web
A recreation of chromiumOS in HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Why?
Why not?!  
Looking for usecases?
- if you want to try chromeOS
- just curious

# What's included?
A chromiumOS based interface and look.

# Known issues
- most of the quick settings do not work
- launcher search is not functional
- most websites dont work in chromium (literally unfixable)
- power button and battery dont work (for firefox and safari)
if you do end up seeing a bug (not on here perferably), please make a github issue!

# Compatibility
Should work fine with Windows/Mac, still prioritizing chromeOS.

# how to use/fork
1. just download the source code, open index.html, push the funny button, and there you go.
2. just fork it and make whatever changes you want. you may have to change some css settings
3. no size worries! the source code is only arround 500kb~ or so, which should not be a huge deal.

# resolution
resolutions are no longer an issue
