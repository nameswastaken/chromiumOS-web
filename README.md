# chromiumOS-web
A recreation of chromiumOS in HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Why?
Why not?!

# What's included?
A chromiumOS based interface and look.

# Known issues
- launcher and most of the quick settings do not work
- tote does not work
- most websites dont work in chromium (literally unfixable)  
if you do end up seeing a bug (not on here perferably), please make a github issue!
# Compatibility
This ___ONLY___ works on chromeOS at the current moment. This might and will change in the future.  
You _can_ use this on Windows/Mac, but it will be missing the default background and favicon.
